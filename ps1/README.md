See writeup.pdf for written answers.

derivative.py was used to produce the plot in question 1 of error vs dx size.
it takes no parameters and shows a plot.

interp_lakeshore.py performs volts->temp interpolateion based on data in lakeshore.txt
the script can take any number of input parameters where each value is a voltage.
When given no parameters it produces output for V = 0.69 hardcoded into the file.
I added headers to lakeshore.txt, so please use the copy I provided, cheers.
